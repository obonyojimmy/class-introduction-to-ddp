**Meteor**<br>
****

The Distributed Data Protocol (DDP) is Meteor's real-time wire protocol based on
simple JSON messages. First you'll learn how a stateful protocol like DDP
differs from HTTP.  Then you'll get a detailed look at the DDP server using the
node-inspector server side debugging tool. Finally we'll create connected sessions
using a command line tool and a browser to learn about DDP sessions.

**What's in this class?**


* <a href="https://www.eventedmind.com/classes/introduction-to-ddp-01cfb402/introducing-ddp-ea8b812b" target="_blank">Introducing DDP</a> - In this class you'll explore the DDP package which gives us the DDP wire
protocol, and the client and server code to work with DDP messages.


* <a href="https://www.eventedmind.com/classes/introduction-to-ddp-01cfb402/what-is-http-84137f6e" target="_blank">What is HTTP?</a> - HTTP is the main protocol used by the Web. It's how Web applications have been
built since the beginning. Learn the difference between the stateless HTTP
protocol and the stateful DDP protocol.


* <a href="https://www.eventedmind.com/classes/introduction-to-ddp-01cfb402/the-ddp-package-e6caf134" target="_blank">The DDP Package</a> - The ddp package gives us the DDP wire protocol, PubSub, Meteor methods and a lot
more. Learn about the client and server parts of the package and where the
source code lives.


* <a href="https://www.eventedmind.com/classes/introduction-to-ddp-01cfb402/debugging-the-server-with-node-inspector-fdee1738" target="_blank">Debugging the Server with Node Inspector</a> - The node-inspector npm module lets us debug server side code. We'll be using it
to learn how DDP works on the server. In this video you'll see two ways to use
node-inspector in your Meteor applications.


* <a href="https://www.eventedmind.com/classes/introduction-to-ddp-01cfb402/the-ddp-server-f6727941" target="_blank">The DDP Server</a> - What does the DDP server object look like? In this video we'll use a server-side
debugging tool to investigate the DDP server and the state it stores in memory.


* <a href="https://www.eventedmind.com/classes/introduction-to-ddp-01cfb402/ddp-sessions-a2fac0ba" target="_blank">DDP Sessions</a> - When a client connects to a DDP server, a new DDP session is created. In this
video you'll see what a connected client looks like on the server. Then we'll
explore the connection object in the browser.
